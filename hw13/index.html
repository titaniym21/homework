            <h2>Cat</h2>
            <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family
                Felidae and often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family. The
                cat is either a house cat, kept as a pet, or a feral cat, freely ranging and avoiding human contact.[5]
                A house cat is valued by humans for companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat
                breeds are recognized by various cat registries.</p>

        <div class="cat_footer">
            <p>Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felid species, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes,
                sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. They are predators who are most active
                at dawn and dusk (crepuscular). Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears,
                such as those made by mice and other small animals. Compared to humans, they see better in the dark
                (they see in near total darkness) and have a better sense of smell, but poorer color vision. Cats,
                despite being solitary hunters, are a social species. Cat communication includes the use of
                vocalizations including mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as
                cat-specific body language.[7] Cats also communicate by secreting and perceiving pheromones.</p>
            <p>Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes ranging from two to
                five kittens. Domestic cats can be bred and shown as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat
                fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, as well as abandonment of
                pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire
                bird species, and evoking population control.</p>
